## Generate Fauna Files with Plop

Running plop and answering the prompts will add an api file with some basic reusable Fauna methods to your repo. This would likely make more sense as a CLI tool than a flop file generator, but as more template files can be added, can also ask more questions in Plop as maybe you will only need a few methods for a simple app. Or maybe you need a few dozen or maybe you need hundreds. Can run different plop with different templates as needed. 

As an example maybe you start with Create a Class, Create a Single Record, Get a Single Record, Delete a Single Record. So then can run an initial fauna scaffold file. Then come back and run another plop command later on when you need more methods/ switch in a different template file.
