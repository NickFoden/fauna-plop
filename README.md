## Generate Fauna Files with Plop

Running plop and answering the prompts will add an api file with some Fauna methods to your repo. This would likely make more sense as a CLI tool than a flop file generator, but as more template files can be added, can ask more questions in Plop as maybe you will only need a few methods for a simple app. Create a Class, Create a Single Record, Get a Single Record, Delete a Single Record. So then can start with initial fauna scaffold file and then add on to it as you need more methods.
